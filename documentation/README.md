## Sitecore SXA - Page Section Module

## Summary
**Category**: Best extension of the editing experience for SXA in Experience Editor

Page Section Module for SXA is a module that will allow marketers and content editor to easily add a section component to a page using experience editor that will enable marketeers to:
* – set up page section parameters and properties in an easy/ graphic manner;
* – trigger a goal on the section once it gets visible on the screen (through scrolling). Allowing marketeers to understand if a specific content in a section is being shown/reached or not.

## What problem does it solve
We have identified when connecting with marketeers and content editors that most of them want to follow a specific layout pattern when adding content to pages. So far the components available using Sitecore Experience Editor and SXA don’t allow as much customization as they often require. Team Noesis Sitecore SXA – Page Section Module, focuses on drag n drop components normalization while being able to customize. Finally, Page Section Module is useful as a data collector and decision support though it’s goal setting feature.
